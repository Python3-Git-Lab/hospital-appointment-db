# Hospital Management System

## CLI Project - Phase 3

### Project Description

Develop a Hospital Management System (HMS) using a Command Line Interface (CLI) that addresses the operational needs of a hospital. The system should cover various aspects, including patient management, appointment scheduling, and medical staff coordination.

### Project Requirements

- **CLI Application:**
  - Create a CLI application that allows users (hospital staff) to interact with the system efficiently.
  - Implement features for managing patients, appointments, and medical staff.

- **Database:**
  - Utilize SQLAlchemy ORM to create and modify a database.
  - Implement at least three related tables in the database.

- **Virtual Environment:**
  - Maintain a well-organized virtual environment using Pipenv.

- **Package Structure:**
  - Establish a proper package structure in your application.

- **Data Structures:**
  - Demonstrate the use of lists, dicts, and tuples in your application.

- **Algorithm Implementation:**
  - Implement an algorithm from the Data Structures and Algorithms Canvas module accurately and appropriately.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Python3-Git-Lab/python-project-end-phase.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd python-project-end-phase
    ```
3. Set up a virtual environment using Pipenv:

    ```bash 
    pipenv install
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    pipenv shell
    ```
5. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pipenv install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6. Run the CLI application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
### Tips and Tricks

- **Database Schema:**
  - Plan your database schema before starting; migrations can be challenging.

- **Module Organization:**
  - Keep your Python objects, SQLAlchemy objects, and CLI script in separate modules.

- **Problem Solving:**
  - If you encounter difficulties with a specific task, check online for Python libraries that can simplify the process.

- **CLI Frameworks:**
  - Consider using Click or Fire to handle basic CLI tasks more efficiently.
